# JS Quizes

## JavaScript Promises (Set 1: Fundamentals)

1. Conceptual: What are the three possible states of a JavaScript Promise?
2. Behavior: What happens if you call `.then()` on a Promise that has already been resolved?
3. Execution: Does the executor function inside `new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })` run immediately or lazily? Explain.
4. Chaining: What does a `.then()` callback need to return in order to allow chaining?
5. Error Handling: What is the difference between `.catch()` and providing a second callback to `.then()` ?
